<h2 class="p4">THE PLAYWORK BOOK</h2>

<p class="pn p2">Far enough below the surface, in
every one of us there lives, very
often almost forgotten, the child,
who, like Peter Pan, "never grows up." It
is this everlasting child in us that keeps
the keys which open for each his Kingdom
of Heaven, and sad it is for those of us
who have lost sight of the keeper of the
keys. The sweetest and loveliest things in
our lives are the simplest things. They
do not abide in the excitable enjoyment of
luxuries and entertainments to be bought
with money; they lie in the living and eternal
interest of the homeliest things of
daily life, wherever people are simple, and
sincere of heart, and full of loving, kindly
thought and care for the concerns of
others; where people do things themselves
instead of paying for them to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
done; where wealth is counted in love, in
thoughtfulness, and in interest in other
people, and not in many possessions. These
things are the heritage of all children, and
we are happy if we can carry our heritage
with us through our life; for this indeed is
to be of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>A child who is unspoiled by the false and
ignorant estimates of others with regard
to the rank and standing of those among
whom he lives, is perhaps our truest socialist.
He comes into the world possessing
nothing, so far as he is aware, save his own
identity; he knows no distinction of class;
his ideas of rank are based solely on the
beauty, charm, and kindness which are in
due proportion the characters of those he
lives with. He makes his own little kingdom
if he is encouraged to work it out, or
play it out, for himself; and happy is the
child and happy is the parent of that child
who learns to play independently, and to
gather together his kingdom, without a
continual cry for assistance from others.
Here is one of the first great landmarks in
education, and a child who is unspoiled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
too many possessions in the way of toys
will be one well provided, for his mind
should at once move to create these possessions
for himself. This power to create,
this moving of the spirit to make something
out of chaos, is in all healthy human
beings, and it is the happiest faculty we
have. It is, in fact, one of the most vital
sides of religion in us, and perhaps the
most important to us. It brings us into
direct kinship with the Great Creator of
all things. This moving of the Holy Spirit
over the chaos of the world, in our businesses,
in our workshops, in our shipyards,
in our buildings, in all craftsman's work
in our factories, is probably never realized
by the churchmen among us, and only
vaguely apprehended by the educational
authorities. Yet does not this very power
of creative thought amongst even the
humblest of us constitute religion of the
most living vitality? This Holy Spirit
moving, and living, and creating anew in
every trade and craft, and in every place
where men are busy, should be better realized
by us, and more respected; we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
then be better men and women. The inventive
minds among us are indeed our
prophets, answering to the call of those
whose labor is too long and heavy, and producing
what will lessen the burden. Answering
again the call for more light, more
beauty, more music in the world, and producing
our arts and our playgrounds, our
games, our schools and colleges. Answering
again the call for freedom from pain,
and we have our hospitals, and our great
doctors, and all who work for the betterment
of the world. Here is the real and
living church of God on earth. They say
we are leaving the churches behind us. Say
rather that the church is more with us, and
all are its ministers who are working for
the world's welfare.</p>

<p>We rebuke far too often that habit of
children of asking questions. We say, "Be
quiet," and "You will see some other day"!
Yet it is by questions that the child shows
most his interest in life, and his inclinations
and desires and tendencies.</p>

<p>We instruct a child for years in the
writings, doings, sayings, and contrivings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of others who have gone before us. How
rarely do we realize that in these little ones
there may be as great, or greater, light
within, only needing care and encouragement
to develop and flame up, and show its
creative strength? It is sad to think how
often these little lights are snuffed out in
their first flickerings by the thoughtless
things we say, by the foolish way we tease
them at the slightest sign of independent
thought, by our ignorant habit of commending
and praising those who give up
their independence, and conform to the
commonplace habits and customs we have
adopted as convenient.</p>

<p>Many very young children show astonishingly
developed faculties in certain directions
even before they can express
themselves in speech. I know a little boy
who, in his second year, showed such an interest
in machinery that his elder relatives
had to learn the parts of a locomotive engine
in order not to betray their own ignorance;
and over and over again we see
the faculties of the creative mind so strong
in young children that it is difficult to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
ourselves that they have not some
previous experience to draw upon. Especially
is this the case in music and the
arts, for here there is perhaps less dependence
on tools and previous technical training
required, than in other constructive
work. But it is sad to see, and very common
also, that these bright beginnings too
often flicker out, not because the spirit is
lacking, but because these children are
only too often driven to hide their lights,
because they feel conspicuous, are teased,
and rebuked, and chidden for their non-conformity,
and are made to feel themselves
outcasts if they pursue the way their
spirit tends to lead them; and they lose
their light, these finer little spirits, and subside
into the twilight of mediocre minds.</p>

<p>It is indeed difficult, in these times of
over-crowded schools and over-worked
teachers, to foster and develop the personalities
of these little ones, but we all look
to a time when education may be a stronger
force among us, more respected and more
desired, when those who teach in our elementary
schools may be the finest men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
women we have, those of the greatest
hearts, and the widest understanding (for
into their hands we place the most precious
thing we have); a time, when, realizing
that the laborer is worthy of his hire, we
must also be brought to realize that the
hire must be worthy of the laborer.</p>

<p>We become more and more socialistic in
our community life in these days, and a
child is now so little left to the charge of
his mother that his life, almost from babyhood
upwards, is just a passing on from
one trained hand to another till he is able
to support himself independently, and often
long after that. His years of school
grow longer and busier, and now even his
playtime is to be more closely guarded and
supervised. Yet it is to be hoped that here
the guarding and supervising will be specially
directed to preserving his independence
and his choice of leisure occupation.</p>

<p>Games are good for all, yet playtime
should emphatically not be all games: this
is where our public schools have failed us;
they have given too much importance to
games, and almost none to private enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in constructive play. In the little
contrivances of children lie the germs of
vast mechanical and artistic enterprises.
The marvelous crafts passed on to us from
ancient days in every land were never the
result of training in schools, they partook
more of the qualities of what I would call
"constructive play," passed on from parent
to child, each new thing a little different
from any other, changing and varying in
every age, yet all through a pleasure and a
joy to their makers. Our trades and our
crafts have all their beginnings in the immature
constructions we make as children.
We build houses, we furnish them, we
make instruments of music (and un-music),
we make ships, we fashion vessels
of clay, and wood, and metal; we weave
and we paint; we dimly foresaw the days
when men should fly like birds, and we
made kites. All this went on for countless
generations, and then we laid captive the
steam and the electric current, and lo! a
change; all things are possible. Yet we
have had a set back; we have forgotten
awhile that the spirit in all of us is greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
than the machine. We have allowed our
machines to make our toys, and instead of
being toy-makers our children have to
some extent become toy breakers, not because
they are really trying to destroy, but
because they have the right and natural
desire to see how a thing is made. It is not
enough, however, to know this; it is very
essential that a child should make for himself,
and the probability is that if the thing
is easily bought he will not take the trouble
to make it. He will be inclined to take it
for granted that just because it is a "commercial"
article, a thing to be bought in a
shop, he cannot make it. Toys imported
from abroad have been so plentiful and so
cheap of late years that the children of to-day
rarely attempt to make them for themselves,
and they are immensely the poorer,
intellectually speaking, for the lack of this
necessity to make them. It is for this reason
that I have gathered together a small
collection of the contrivances of past generations,
and the present generation too, not
in order that they serve as mere subjects
for copy, but because in making such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
things children develop ideas for improving
upon them, and for making new things.</p>

<p>This little collection of works and enterprises
is brought together as a suggestion
for what Scottish folk so aptly call "ploys,"
which the children may undertake without
much help or instruction. Later on it may
be possible to collect a more mature series
of suggestions for recreative work in evening
schools and continuation classes.
There are people everywhere whose work
during the day is so taxing that they cannot
continue to strain mind and hand at the
usual subjects given in evening schools,
and yet they can learn to employ their leisure
time very profitably by work which
does not demand either mental strain, nor
highly developed skill, nor any elaborate
outfit, nor noisy methods of construction.
It must be truly "leisure" work, and be
planned to give refreshment and stimulation
and "play" to weary brain and body.</p>

<p>Such gentle fireside crafts as the decoration
of pottery, and coarse and effective
needlework are delightful to practice of an
evening, and need give no trouble to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
tidy and anxious Marthas of the household.
No evenings are more pleasant than those
I have spent with friends all busy at quiet
crafts round the hearth, chatting a little,
or listening to a reader, or singing simple
songs in parts, and with no accompaniment
of instruments. Constructive design for
either of these two crafts is a delightful
thing for either men or women of any age.
We are never too old to learn to design patterns
so long as our hands are able to guide
a pen. For what is writing but pattern.
Each of us writes his or her name to an individual
design, easily recognized so soon
as our hand has learned to control our instrument.
Patterns for these simple crafts
should therefore emanate from the minds
of the workers themselves, and should
never be copied if it is possible to avoid it.</p>

<p>This spirit of creativeness and invention
should find a special period for its development
in the day's time-table, and it would
be immensely helpful and interesting if
teachers would make collections of "outstanding"
productions from the children,
and if little loan collections of these might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
travel round from place to place. The
children themselves are always intensely
interested in seeing such things&mdash;and
sometimes the older folk who have not forgotten
to be children are even more so.
I have always urged that craft-work from
our various educational centers should go
"on tour" in this way, and I keep a large
quantity of needlework which shows individuality,
from all sorts of schools, going
round the country. This usually is shown
to teachers only, which limits its sphere,
for the children themselves show a most
enthusiastic interest in it, and whenever I
have shown such work to children in elementary
schools, the chorus of excited
little voices usually repeats, "Oh, I could
do that," which is exactly what is needed
for a good beginning. How charming it
would be if municipalities would have in
every museum a section of "modern craft
work," independent of the collections of
antiquities we store up. For we also have
beautiful things being created amongst us,
no less beautiful because they result from
the demands of modern needs and usages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>New habits of life produce new demands,
and children quickly catch new ideas and
adapt themselves to the use of hitherto unknown
materials. This is especially the
case in cities, and the suggested constructions
for the playwork subjects in this book
are almost all made out of the waste materials
the children may readily find at
hand, and they are put together as far as
possible, without any particular need for
skill, and with the fewest and simplest of
tools. In the country there is always an
immense wealth of superfluous material to
play with, and the country child has a far
greater treasury from which to supply the
need of hand and mind than his neighbor
of the city. Imagination can find an immensity
of outlet and opportunity, even in
the neighborhood of cities. I remember
well my village of cave dwellings which I
carefully hollowed out beneath the spreading
roots of trees&mdash;very dirty trees&mdash;in a
suburban wood in a Lancashire town. The
caves were furnished with stones and
twigs, and populated with earwigs or any
creeping thing to be found and housed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
there. Later I owned an island in a Westmorland
Lake, and had a beautiful house
of woven branches of the growing rowan
trees, with a garden planted with ferns and
wild flowers among mossy bordered paths.
And again, my sisters and brothers and I
made fine wigwams of the branches of
young oak and hazel trees found in those
lakeland woods; they were tied together
at the top with the fibrous stems of honeysuckle,
spread tentwise at the base, and
heaped outside with a covering of dead
bracken and dry leafy twigs. In town too,
for wet days there was always the house
under the table, walled in with table cover
and blankets: delightful dwellings all, and
happy little "homes" to live in, for any
place is a "home" to us when we look back
to it with happy memory. And the garlands
we made of daisies and red clover,
thick as a man's arm and plaited strongly
together, with which we decked the
clothes-props on the drying green, and
made them into Maypoles! We remember
the joy these things gave, chiefly because
we made them; we remember them far better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
than the games we played, or the entertainments
we went to.</p>

<p>At school again, my best personal experience,
and one that I have found valuable
above all the other education I got, was not
the lessons I learned from books; I have
forgotten almost all I got from them. It
was the great days when we had plays in
school, and I was allowed to devise, and
practically direct the whole making of the
stage properties. A great time that. We
made armor, and weapons, and crowns, and
garments, and wings, and scenery. We had
no assistance from teachers for this, and I
know it taught me more than any of my
teachers did. During school days I did not
learn to draw because I had a drawing lesson
once a week, and painfully and carefully
drew perspectives of chairs and
schoolrooms and other dull things. I
learned to draw because I loved to scribble
in my lesson books princes and princesses,
and fairies, and because I had few playthings,
and was always making and decorating
little gifts for other people.</p>

<p>This practise of decorating the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
we make is really far the best way to teach
drawing to either children or others. We
make our education in drawing a far too
limited affair by directing it to a pictorial
issue alone, and drawing is a far wider subject
than concerns picture-making solely.
If we go into our museums, we see from
the ancient handicrafts left to us by primitive
peoples, that in the beginning all art
was purely applied to useful things. The
clay jar modelled in the hands alone, with
its lines and curves just emphasized with a
few scratches or impressions made with a
stick or a bone, what is this but just play?
and yet it is art also and the art adds immensely
to the value of that jar. So also
to-day, if any child takes a piece of clay
and makes a vessel by hand, the very same
thing is produced. I have seen little pots
made in schools which it is difficult to distinguish
from some of those of ancient
Egypt or Peru in our museums. They are
not one whit less artistic, and yet the art
is quite unconscious, the child was only
"playing" with the clay.</p>

<p>We would be much the richer, commercially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
speaking, if schools would only take
up this different side of art teaching&mdash;making
patterns, instead of pictures. I am
not condemning the drawing of pictures,
but I am urging that pattern-making&mdash;constructive
design in actual material, not
on paper&mdash;should come first. Pattern is
the mathematics of art, and it can develop
the mathematical faculties far more widely
than mere mental calculations can. It
must be learned by wise gradations, and
the learner must never be allowed to get
out of hand or run riot with over-elaboration.
If we can teach the children in their
drawing lessons to decorate the useful articles
they need for the home, we shall give
a great impetus to the commercial arts.
For example, if a child has one lesson at
decorating a piece of pottery with a brush
dipped in glaze paint and decorates it with
nothing but a line of dots or strokes, he can
have this fired and fixed and use it, and
he also at once looks at every china shop
with a sharply discriminating eye. In a
very short time he will be able to choose
between good decoration and bad, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
understand economy in production, he will
very soon demand from the trade a higher
class of design, and he will be willing to
pay for better design because he understands
the working of it.</p>

<p>The fashion for amateurs to practice
photography did not do harm to the professional
photographer, as was feared at first;
it raised the standard of professional work,
and brought more custom, and not less, to
the professional worker. And this holds
good in all work, the more widely and
thoroughly it is "understanded of the
people," the more desirable do the people
find it.</p>

<p>There is a great education before art
teachers, and they must realize that they
must come into touch with science and
mathematics and general constructive
work. They must watch the changing
needs and fashions of the day, and realize
that not only in classic times was the art
of the people a beautiful and desirable
thing. They must realize, too, that in this
Twentieth Century our hands are extending
their powers, and that by the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
machines we are reaching a far larger public
than unaided hands could do. The artist
has spent two or three generations bewailing
the machine; he forgot that no machine
can, of its own powers, be artistic or
inartistic. He left the machine alone, and
therefore the machine-work has fallen into
discredit. The artist craftsman is too
often too conscious of his art, and does not
subordinate himself sufficiently to modern
ways and conditions. It is not the fault of
the machine that much of our manufactured
output is inartistic, it is the fault of
the artist that he has not managed to control
the machine. First and foremost,
however, we must have some change in the
training of artists, and must direct their
attention to utility, rather than pictorial
work. It is difficult to count the outlets
possible to the decorative craftsman, provided
he understands modern machinery
and commercial demands. This training in
handicraft begins, very rightly and naturally
in the kindergarten schools, but there,
unfortunately, it stops short. Now what
we want to do is to plan out for our growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
children such crafts as will develop intelligence
and skill of hand, without demanding
too great physical strength or
technical training, and without undue expenditure
of money upon materials and
outfit.</p>

<p>For the younger children the easiest
media to work in are clay and needlework.
The clay-work should be directed to the
most permanent and useful things that can
be produced; pottery and tiles can be very
easily made, and are very permanent if
they are glazed and fired and decorated,
and this can be done at very little expense.
Needlework must be taught so that the
worker develops intelligence and independence,
and is no longer made to sew the
multitudes of fine stitches which were once
considered necessary, and which made the
girls mere unthinking machines. There
are endless new ways to be followed out in
the sewing and embroidery and construction
of garments and household textiles.
Even the rather mechanical knitting is
probably only in its infancy as yet, and we
may see it do great things, and play a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
beautiful part in our textile arts. To reform
and renew the vitality of all these
things we must realize that they have all
their beginnings in the playwork of the
little child, and that simply because the
little child has no traditions to unlearn, and
is therefore independent enough to think
out new devices in his play, so must we all
keep before us the fact that we have that
light within us which is above, and independent
of, traditions.</p>

<p>If we can see any way in which any work
can be improved or altered, or beautified
by some change in its treatment, we must
be bold to try it, for only by courage and
bravery of thought does the work of the
world keep itself fresh and ever renewed
and changing towards better things.
Never be afraid that because you have not
tried to do a thing you will be unable to do
it. If the thought of doing it has come to
you, it is a sign that some power is there,
at any rate, and the impulse to improve
and change a thing for the better is just
that creative impulse stirring within,
which I have pleaded for. Whose is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
impulse? Not our own entirely. Then
surely if it is good, we do right at least to
try to carry it out. It is the Mind that
changes matter, but it is not your mind nor
mine, though it is in our charge. And
happy is he who has faith to listen and give
it force and visible expression.</p>

<p>There are in this little book things that
many of the wiser folk shake their heads
over&mdash;catapults for instance. Yet I have
put them in; for surely if we older folk
had not enjoyed our catapults we should
probably have been sadder folk, as well
as wiser. All children may some day or
other handle instruments of offense and
destruction, and it is part of their legitimate
education to learn to do no harm with
them, so I have put in the catapult. I enjoyed
playing with mine, and I do not think
I ever broke anything with it, I do not even
remember hitting anything I aimed at, and
probably this is the average experience. I
have not attempted to enter into any
lengthy suggestions as regards making
boats, or other toys requiring much patience
and skill and knowledge of tools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Boat-making is a most interesting thing
for both boys and girls, and can be carried
to great perfection by them, if they have
perseverance. I see no reason why the
making of model boats and mechanical
toys should not be the special work of
boys' manual classes, nor is there any reason
why a great quantity of the craft-work
and needlework in day and evening schools
should not be commercialized, and disposed
of by the educational authorities, both to
the advantage of the teachers and the pupils.
One field alone&mdash;that of providing
souvenirs for sale to tourists&mdash;is a large
one, and is at present open to the schools.
Tourists do not come here with any desire
to buy souvenirs made abroad; they would
greatly prefer things with a local flavor,
and preferably small and portable. I know
from personal experience how immensely
such a market encourages students to work
at their classes in the evenings. We could
keep the evening schools packed with students
if they realized that their work, done
in leisure hours, had some prospect of
bringing in a return instead of involving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
outlay alone. This also is playwork; and
though this small book deals only with
such playwork in its infancy, yet it must
be emphatically urged that it develops into
great things, things that the nation needs,
and which can only come to their full development
because the nation's children
have learned to play.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to my grandfather,
grandmother, and my father and mother,
and to my nurses whose names I have forgotten,
but from whom I learned to make
many things. Also to Mrs. Grisedale, Mrs.
Wear, Mrs. Fry, Mrs. Fellows, Miss Allright,
Miss Worsdell, Miss Douglas, Miss
Arthur, Mr. J. T. Ewen, H.M.I., Mr. Forrester
Wilson, and to Norman Guild, for
many suggestions, and for their very practical
help.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A WOOLLEN BALL</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A small strip of thick cardboard, a small piece of
string, wool, scissors.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-034.jpg" width="400" height="219"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 1 and 2.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is the easiest of all the things one
can make in wool. Take a narrow piece of
stiff cardboard, or a flat stick about five
inches long and about one inch wide, and
make a slit at each end: between these two
slits stretch a piece of thin string and then,
about the middle of the strip of cardboard,
wind the wool over and over till it is like a
ball. Do not allow the wool to spread too
far along the cardboard. When the ball of
wool is two, or two and a half inches in
diameter, loosen the string from the slits,
and slip out the cardboard carefully from
the ball; you will not have a bundle of
wool with a string running through all the
loops. Tie the string up tightly and knot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
it well, then take your scissors and cut the
loops as in Figure 2. After all the loops
are cut you will have to clip all the loose
ends, till they are about even in length, and
the bundle will now be a nice regular shape.
This is a somewhat wasteful way of making
a ball, and should only be used by very
little children with waste wool or cotton
yarn. It teaches them, however, a very
useful thing&mdash;to wind wool evenly, and to
cut and trim it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">ANOTHER WOOLLEN BALL</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Two used postcards or pieces of thin cardboard,
a strong darning needle, odd pieces of bright-colored
wools, scissors.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-035.jpg" width="400" height="244"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 3 and 4.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">A very much better way to make a woollen
ball, but more difficult, is shown in Figures
3 and 4. Here you must first have a
piece of fairly stiff cardboard and on it lay
a teacup or tumbler with the rim on the
cardboard. Draw with a pencil, or scratch
with the scissors round the rim so that
you have a circle about three and a half or
four inches across on it, and cut these circles
out. Then take some smaller circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
thing, a quarter, or something about that
size, and place it carefully in the center of
each of your larger circles, and cut out the
smaller circle like a hole in the middle of
the bigger one. Now take some wool&mdash;you
can have it of many bright colors, and if
you have any old woollen knitted things
which you do not need you can unravel
them. Slip one end of your wool through
the hole of both pieces of cardboard when
they are laid together, tie it in a knot, and
with your fingers at first, and later with a
darning needle, keep winding the wool
through the hole and over and over the
cardboard until it is all covered. Go on
winding it through the hole, until the hole
is so full that even your needle will not
push through. Then you must take sharp
scissors and carefully cut the wool at the
outer edge of this round cushion you have
wound, till the scissors cut into the cardboard,
so that you can slip one point between
the two cards and cut right round
the circle. You must be careful not to let
the wool be pulled out of the hole through
which you have threaded it. Now take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a piece of thin strong string, slip it round
between the two cardboard circles, wind it
two or three times, and tie it very tightly.
Next, carefully tear away your two cardboard
rounds and you will have a fine firm
ball, which only needs cutting and trimming
with the scissors into an even shape.
You can make this ball look very pretty by
arranging your wool as you wind it into
different layers of varying color or make a
quarter of your circle of one color and the
next quarter of another, and so on. Small
balls made like this make pretty pompoms
for shoes and hats, and tassels on bags, or
they can be fixed on drawstrings in underclothing,
to prevent them coming out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A SPRIG OF FLOWERS</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A little thin cardboard, wools of various bright
colors, milliner's wire, a small darning needle,
scissors.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-039.jpg" width="400" height="369"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 5 to 9.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This can be made very much as the second
woollen ball is made. You take a circle
of cardboard again, but rather a smaller
one about two inches across (a small ink
bottle or an egg-cup would give about the
right size); and cut in it a round hole about
as big as a dime. Wind bright-colored
wool through the hole and over the cardboard
very evenly, using a darning needle
because it is such a small hole. Wind on
wool until all the cardboard is covered
evenly. Then take a piece of wire about
six inches long, or a hairpin will do if
straightened out. You can do this by holding
the ends tightly in each hand and rubbing
the pin backwards and forwards
against the edge of a table. At one end of
the wire bend it, so that it makes a little
loop, the smaller the better. Now begin
with green wool to wrap round the wire,
covering in the loop first, and when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
have covered in the whole loop wind the
wool over the end of the bent piece again,
and bind it tightly to the other portion, and
go on down the wire for some distance.
With another hairpin (not straightened
out this time, but bent as much to a point
as possible) or another piece of wire bent
like a V, tie the green wool at the bend,
and wind in and out from one side of the
wire to the other, first letting the sides go
wide from each other and then gradually
tightening them together, till you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
them closed again and they become a leaf
shape. Bind this leaf into the first wire
stem, and add more leaves if you wish.
Now wind over the first two fingers of
your left hand some yellow or dark-colored
wool about a dozen times, and take
the end of the wool and tie it through when
you withdraw your fingers, as in making
the first woollen ball. Hold these loops
tight from this knotted part, and wind the
end of the wool round till it is like Figure
6, a little tassel; take your darning needle
and sew this tassel into the hole in the
circle of cardboard so that it makes a center
for your flower, and sew the cardboard
flower to the loop at the end of the wire.
You can make two or three small tassels
for this center if you like, and bind them
first around the loop so that they fill up the
hole in the cardboard quite tightly. More
tassels can be made and tied to wires and
bound into the main wire stem like little
buds. These sprigs look very pretty when
worn in hats, and they will not spoil with
the rain: you can also put a large spray in
a vase when you cannot get real flowers.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="p4">A SKIPPING ROPE</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Some cheap thin string or cotton waste, some small
twigs, a pencil or penholder, a strong hook fixed
in a wall.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-042.jpg" width="400" height="231"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 10 to 12.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Take three or four lengths of thin string&mdash;a
very cheap quality will do&mdash;about three
yards long, and tie them into a knot close to
each end. Be sure that every separate
piece is of the same length. Then take one
knotted end and slip the knot round a hook
in the wall, not too high up; a curtain hook
will do very well, or any other knob or projecting
thing which will allow a very small
loop to slip off and on, and which will hold
firmly. Into the other end, at the knot,
slip a pencil or penholder, and hold the
strand of strings or threads with the left
thumb and forefinger loosely, just beyond
the place the pencil is slipped into it, as in
Figure 10. With the right hand first finger
hit the pencil round and round away from
you, <i>downwards</i>, keeping it whirling so
that the long strand becomes twisted. Do
not hold too tight with the left hand, but
be sure to keep the strands taut from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hook where they are fastened. Keep on
whirling until the strand is twisted so
tightly that it begins to go into kinks. Then
get somebody to catch the strand about
the middle, and keeping it carefully taut
all the time walk round until you bring the
pencil end up to the hook, and slip the
strand from the pencil on to the hook.
Then take the pencil to where the strand
is being held in the middle and slip it into
the doubled end, and holding it as tightly
as possible from the hook, as before, whirl
the pencil in the opposite direction, towards
you, <i>upwards</i>, as in Figure 11. This
will make a beautiful cord. The pencil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
can be slipped out now, and the ends on the
hook must be knotted together so that the
cord will not unravel. This is called a
"twofold cord," and it can be made in two
colors if you divide the length before the
first twisting into two equal lengths of differently
colored threads. A "threefold
cord," can be made in the same way, but it
must be folded into three different lengths
before the second twisting, and three different
colors may be introduced. A threefold
cord is much fuller and firmer than a
twofold one. Cords can be made of wool
or silk or any kind of thread, and must be
made of few or many strands according to
the thickness required, and according to
the thickness of the strands used. Thin
woollen cords are very nice to run into
woolen garments as drawstrings, or into
bags; thick ones made of knitting yarn are
splendid for dressing-gowns, and the ends
can be finished off with tassels.</p>

<p>If you make a skipping rope in this way
you will want a firm handle at each end,
and you can make it by getting three or
four small sticks or twigs, and laying them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
close to each end round your cord. Then
bind these round, at both ends of your skipping
rope, with firm twine. Next take the
end of the rope which projects beyond the
twigs, and double the strands back along
the twigs for a short distance, and bind
them down again and cut away any superfluous
length, and knot your binding string
firmly. This will make a very pretty little
handle, especially if you can get pretty
greenish twigs with the bark on them and
tie with colored threads or twine. Figure

<h2 class="p4">A SUCKER</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A small piece of thick leather, strong string, scissors
or penknife.</b></p>

</div></div>

<p>This is a very interesting toy to play
with. It is very simple to make: all it
needs is a round piece of
fairly thick leather about
four inches across. Cut this
into a perfect circle with a
knife, if the leather is too
thick to cut with scissors,
and in the very middle bore
a small hole and put through
this a piece of strong string,
about a yard long, and tie a
knot in this so that it will
not slip through the hole.
Now soak your leather in
water till it is very soft and
damp, and keep it in this condition whenever
you use it. By dropping the round of
damp leather quickly on to the surface of
a smooth stone you will be able to lift and
carry quite large stones. You must be sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to drop the sucker on to the smooth surfaces,
because if there are any little crevices
under the sucker the air in them will
prevent suction.</p>

<h2 class="p4">GOLLIWOGS</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Colored wools, a little string, cotton, or silk, and
a tiny piece of tape; a large-eyed needle, scissors.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 14 to 18.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">These golliwogs are made of tassels of
wool. First wind your tassel over your
fingers much as you wound it for the first
woollen ball on the cardboard. Then cut
the loops, and tie very tightly with several
turns of strong cotton or silk close to the
end, and again about half an inch lower.
This forms the head, and the ends at the
top can be trimmed into a top knot. Below
the head, divide off a small portion on
each side for the arms, and tie each of
these again about half way down, and cut
off just below the tied portion, where the
dotted line is in Figure 14. Tie also for the
waist at the double dotted line, and then, if
legs are required, divide the remaining
part of the tassel into two, and tie at the
feet. Take a needle with thread or wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of a different color from that you have
used for the golliwog, and stitch in eyes
and nose. Figure 15 makes a very good
Zulu chief, if he is made in black wool.
Figure 16 is a Red Cross nurse. She can
be made in light blue or gray wool, and her
cap and apron are made of a small piece of
tape, each sewn with a red cross. Her cap
must be folded and stitched up the back
like Figure 17, and her neck, wrists, and
belt must be wound with white thread.
The little turban golliwog, Figure 18, has
his headdress made of a short bundle of
wool of another color pushed through the
folded loop of wool which forms his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
His arms also can be a separate bundle of
strands pushed through the body portion.</p>

<h2 class="p4">THE MEAL SACK</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A tiny piece of calico, white cotton, cotton wool,
scent powder or lavender flowers, several apple pips,
needle and thread, and scissors.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 19 to 21.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This makes a very pretty scent bag or
pincushion.</p>

<p>Take a small piece of calico or any cotton
scrap, about three inches wide and six
inches long, and fold it across the middle.
Take a needle and cotton and tack it up the
sides, and down again, if you cannot make
small stitches, keeping both rows of stitches
very close together. Now fray out the
threads at the ends of your strip, and turn
the bag inside out. You can fill it with
lavender if you like, or stuff it with cotton
wool and some powdered scent; or you can
stuff it quite tight with bran instead, and
make a pincushion of it. Tie the opening
up tightly with strong thread, Figure 20.
Now take one or two pips from an apple or
an orange, to make a mouse: if it is an
apple pip take a penknife and scratch out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
eyes and ears, as in Figure 21. If you use
an orange pip you can ink in the eye and
the ear. Now stitch your little mouse on
to your meal sack, and it will be a very
dainty little gift to put by for Christmas.
You can also make pretty sets of scent
bags out of bits of ribbon or silk patterns
from the dressmaker's, or cut off any old
scraps of thin materials you find. Make
six little bags of different colors and stuff
with cotton wool and scent, and tie round
the neck of each the end of a piece of narrow
baby ribbon; tie the first bag with a
piece nine inches long, and each of the
other bags should have a ribbon a little
longer than the last. Then tie all the loose
ends of the six ribbons together with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bow of ribbon, and you will have a charming
cluster of sachets to hang in a wardrobe.</p>

<h2 class="p4">AN EMERY CUSHION</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A tiny piece of red ribbon or silk, a tiny piece of
calico or cotton material, strong red cotton thread,
yellow or  silk thread,  green wool,  a little  emery
powder, a  tiny piece of hard soap  or wax  candle,
scissors, and crewel needle.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 22 to 24.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">To make this you must get a little bright
red material about three inches square and
a little thin cotton material the same size.
Lay both together and fold them diagonally
across from corner to corner with the
red material inside, and with fine thread
and needle and very small stitches sew it
from the  two loose  corners up  to the  point
where it  is folded,  so that it  forms  a triangular
bag. Now the bag should be folded
over so that you can measure off on the
diagonal fold the same length as the
stitched seam, and cut away the extra material
as in Figure 22. Now take some hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
soap, or a piece of wax candle, and rub it
hard all over the cotton material in order
to prevent your emery stuffing getting out,
trim off any extra thickness of material at
the point, and turn the bag red side out
and run it very finely round the opening
with strong needle and thread. Draw the
thread up a little, as in Figure 23, and now
take your emery powder and fill up tight
with that. If you cannot get emery get
some fine dry sand, or you can even pound
up some cinders out of the fire, and fill your
little bag very tight with the powder you
make, and draw up the thread and stitch it
very close. Next you must take your green
wool or silk, and make long loop stitches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
all round the top until all the opening and
the gathered up portion is neatly covered
with these stitches, like sepals on a flower.
Stitch on a little cord or loop of ribbon, and
with a yellow thread make even stitches
all over your little bag, till it looks just like
a strawberry&mdash;Figure 24.</p>

<h2 class="p4">RAT-TAIL KNITTING</h2>


<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A large cork, large reel, or a small piece of a narrow
cardboard roller, strong pins, preferably those known
as "laundry pins," a small crochet hook, colored
wools.</b></p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-053.jpg" width="150" height="279"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p>This is known as rat-tail knitting, or
cork or bobbin work. It can be made either
by boring a hole in a large flat cork and
setting seven or eight pins in round this
hole, or by setting the pins into a reel with
a large hole, but I have found the best
thing is to get a small tube of cardboard
such as paper is rolled on (out of a toilet
roll, for instance), and to stick the pins
firmly into the cardboard, as in Figure 25.
Five or six pins will do. Take colored wool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and loop it once round
each pin, then wrap it
very loosely once round
the whole circle of pins,
and, with another large
pin or a small crochet
hook, lift each loop up
and over the last wrap of
the thread, and over the
head of the pin. Do this
right round the circle of
pins, so that you have
now a second series of
loops made from the thread which was
wrapped round above the first ones, while
the first loops have begun to descend into
the tube. Work round and round till the
end of your knitted rat-tail appears out
of the tube at the lower end. You can knot
on lengths of wool of other colors and
make very pretty reins with them. You
can, if you like, work with two differently
colored threads, all the time using one color
for the loops you lift, over a wrap thread
of another color, alternating as you work
round and round your circle. This is really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
just the way a knitting-machine works,
very much simplified. You can do the
same on a larger scale with a wooden ring
into which pegs of wood are inserted, and
this will make quite a large woollen muffler.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A PEEP-SHOW PICTURE</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A small piece of glass from an old photograph-frame,

<p class="p1">Collect a tiny bunch of the smallest flowers
you can find, daisies, buttercups, violets,
even little weeds like chickweed, and
small grasses, clover leaves, or sprays of
moss; tie them very loosely in a little
bunch. Now lay your piece of glass down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
on your paper (the paper may be any color,
but the blue sugar-bag paper looks very
pretty.) Take your little bunch of flowers
and arrange it flat on the glass, with the
faces of the flowers pressed against the
glass, and the leaves and moss pressed flat
on top of them. Put the prettiest side of
them next the glass. When all the surface
of the glass is fairly well covered fold the
paper over the flowers so that it makes a
neat parcel, and fasten down the corners
of the parcel with stamp paper. Then turn
your parcel over, and round three sides,
about half an inch from the edge, cut a neat
line, so that the paper will now lift like a
flap and show your very pretty picture.
Seaweeds can be used instead of flowers&mdash;and
if so, they should be arranged on the
glass in a dish of water and floated into
place.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a very good toy to play with, and
can be easily made. Get a piece of cardboard
about six inches square and draw a
line from corner to corner and cut it across.
Then roll this triangle of cardboard into a
long cone shape, about two and a half inches
wide at the open end, and with a strip
of thin gummed paper across the overlapping
edge fix it down tight, so that it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
not open out again. With the scissors trim
the open end to an even round. Next take
a large piece of tissue or any other thin
soft paper, and roll it into a neat round ball,
which must loosely fit the opening of the
cone. Wind a thread of wool over it in
one direction, and another so that it keeps
its shape. Now, if you can get a piece of
a black veil, or some very thin soft net or
muslin, cover over the ball so that it looks
quite neat and round and even, and stitch
a thin string about eighteen inches long to
it. You can now cover the cup also with
the veiling if you wish to, and if so, leave
about three inches over at the open end,
which must be drawn together, and the
draw thread then pushed down inside the
cone and fastened off at the closed end. It
can have a little cork put in to fill it up.
Put the end of the string through a hole
near the opening of the cone and your cup
and ball is finished.</p>

several pieces of thick cardboard and paste
them together, or take the lid of a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
cardboard box and make holes for the ends
of the legs in it, and after pushing the ends
of the hairpins through, run them into
small pieces of cork, so that they will keep
in place when standing. Now get a burnt
match and sharpen it at either end, and
push one end of it into the head, and the
other into the body, and set the legs into
place in the body also. Use hairpins that
have no waves or angles in them, so that
the bend of the pin makes the right bend
for the leg. Make the beak of two matches,
trimmed to a sharp point, and you can
use a tiny black bead for the eyes, or draw
them with ink. The feathers for the crest
and wings and tail must be stuck into holes,
after having a little mucilage put on the

<h2 class="p4">A DOLL'S BED</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">First cover the bottom of the cardboard
box with a layer of soft material or wadding,
with thin cotton over it, and take
large tacking stitches to fasten this down.
Next fix on your canopy by setting the lid
upright on to the end of the box, and glue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
or fix it into place with stationers' paper
clips or large stitches. Trim the canopy
round the top with a little frill of lace or
muslin, and put the same, as a valance,
round the bed portion. You can also add
curtains at each side of the canopy, and, if
you want a footboard, that also can be
fixed across the bottom with big stitches
or paper clips before the valance frill is
sewed on. You can make quite large beds
in this way, and if you have not a very
pretty box you can trim it up with pieces of
wall-paper pasted inside the canopy.</p>

<p class="p1">This chair is harder to make than the last
one. First cut a piece of cardboard or two
pieces of old post cards to the shape
marked A. It must be large enough to allow
it to reach halfway round the top of
a reel at its widest part, where the corners
are. Now tack on to this a piece of velveteen
or any other pretty material, so that
the edges turn over to the wrong side of
the cardboard. On the second piece of card
take the material only down just a little
below the two corners of the cardboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and you need not turn it in on the straight
edge between these corners. Tack both
cards together with the material outside,
and overseam or topsew them as shown in
Figure 40 A. Next take your reel and bind
tightly over each end of it a round piece of
material, and then take a narrow strip of
material or ribbon, and turn in the edges
and wrap it round the reel as in 40 B, and
tack the strip into place very tight. Now
fix on the back as in 40 C with neat little
stitches, and your chair is finished.</p>

strong paper or a piece of a postcard about
half an inch across and take a strong short
pin and put it through the middle. Then
push your pin through each right-hand corner
of your square of writing paper, and
lastly through the center of the square, and
take a piece of stick or a penholder and
push the point of the pin in till it is halfway
in. You will find your windmill will
turn as you run, if you hold it out straight
in front of you. If you can get two good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sticks you can use a long one as the upper
part of a weather vane. Rut a nail
through, rather nearer your pinwheel
than the middle of the stick. At the other
end make a long slit and put in a paper tail,
so that the pinwheel will keep its head to
the wind. Fix your nail into the end of the
other stick, and set the stick upright in the
ground as in Figure 50.</p>

<p class="p1">This windmill is made of tin; this is rather
difficult to cut unless your hands are
strong, but sometimes you can get very
thin tin or brass from kindergarten stores,
and it is quite easy to make it of this. Draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a circle about four inches across on the tin,
round a jam pot or some such thing to give
you a good even circle, and cut this out
with the scissors. Now take a ruler and
scratch lines across your circle, at right
angles first, so that you have your circle
divided into quarters; now divide these
quarters again into three or four divisions,
and draw a smaller circle on your tin about
three quarters of an inch, or less, from the
outer edge. Now make a clean cut with
the scissors from the edge to the inner
circle along each line. The tin will always
bend in one way as you do this, and you
must leave the little divisions bent very
evenly. Make a hole in the center of your
wheel and fix it strongly with a nail into a
stick. You will find you can hardly hold
your windmill if you stand with it facing
a steady wind. This windmill is a grand
one to go.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A WOODEN MILL</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Two narrow strips of thin, soft wood, a stick for

</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is a wooden mill and it requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
some care and skill to make it. It can easily
be made with a penknife out of two
pieces of thin, soft wood. First you must
cut a neat socket across each piece of wood
in the center, halfway through its thickness.
The socket must be exactly the same
width as your piece of wood, so that when
you set each piece socket to socket they
fit exactly. Now with an awl or pricker
make a neat hole in the center of the two
pieces when they are fitted together. Next
you must shave away with your penknife
the right-hand edge of each of the "arms"
or "sails" of your windmill, graduating the
shaving evenly from the left-hand edge,
where it is thick, to a fine blade at the
right-hand edge. Now fit together the two
halves and put a nail through the hole and
fasten it into the end of a stick. If the nail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
is apt to split the stick you can put a reel
on to the end of it and fix the nail into the
stick through the hole of the reel. It is a
very good thing to put your nail through a
large glass bead between the windmill and
the stick.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A FEATHER WHEEL</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">This windmill is made of goose quills, or
any other large strong quill; these must be
chosen with the wider webbing of the
feather all on the same side, and must be
the same size. Cut a circle of firm cardboard
and lay each quill with its point in
the middle of this circle and stitch them
firmly down at right angles to each other.
Glue the wrong side of the cardboard on
to a reel or a piece of cork, and fix this on
the end of a small stick or penholder. Now
take a small cylindrical cardboard box&mdash;those
used for gas mantles are excellent&mdash;and
bore holes through opposite sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this, about halfway
down. Push the stick
through and fix into a
slit at the end of it a
"tail" of paper or cardboard.
Take another
piece of cardboard and
shape it into a cone, exactly
as in Figure 27 for
the cup and ball. Cut a
hole in the bottom of your box and fit it on
to the end of the cone, which must be cut
down to allow the stick to pass clear of the
end of the cone.</p>

hole through the cork and the cross of
wood, and through it run a nail with a fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

<h2 class="p4">A WATERWHEEL AND SHUTE</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Smooth straight twigs about half an inch thick,
a thin wooden sweet-box or other light wooden box,
two small pieces of white soft wood, about one-third

</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is a waterwheel with a watershute,
and it turns a crank and has a little man
attached. The waterwheel has flat blades
with no bevelling, and a thick wire is inserted
through its axis. This wire should
be bent with pliers to form the cranks. Set
up crosswise into the ground some strong
twigs tied firmly into position with strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
twine. If there is a handy little stream it
should be diverted to run a channel into
your watershute, which should be of two
flat pieces of wood nailed together at right
angles; this can also be supported on trestles.
Set the shute so that the end is above
the blade of the waterwheel and allows the
water to fall on it with sufficient force to
turn it round. The man may be cut with
a fret-saw in three ply wood, and small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
staples should be run loosely through the
holes at the ankles into a thicker piece of
wood which acts as a base, so that with the
movement of the crank he will appear to
be turning the wheel. Fasten arms and
legs to the body with a thick wire which
works loosely in the holes, or with a thin
nail which may be bent over at the point.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is a most simple little toy and very
easy to make. Get a large quill feather
with as wide and strong a quill as you can,
and cut it off where the quill is thickest.
Then get a little stick or branch, preferably
a little bent at the thicker end, and peel
and smooth it, so that it will fit nicely into
the quill with the thicker bent end projecting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
This makes the ramrod, but it must
be fitted into the quill so that it reaches
only within half an inch of the pointed or
smaller end. Now take a slice of raw potato
about half an inch thick or a little
more, and into it push the wider end of the
quill so that it takes out a neat round piece
of the potato. With the ramrod gently
push this first "bullet" to the smaller end
of the quill and take out another slice from
the potato with the wide end. Now quickly
and smartly push in your ramrod and
you will find your first bullet shoots off
splendidly, leaving your second one at the
point of the quill ready for the next shot.
Large popguns can be made with a piece
of tin tubing, or even cardboard rollers and
corks used as bullets. The ramrod must
be padded with cotton wrapping in order to
fit the tube closely.</p>

<p class="p1">This can be made of sycamore cherry,
holly, or willow branches, where there is a
fairly thick coating of sappy bark outside
the firm woody fiber. Choose a piece about
four inches long without knots and as
smooth as possible. Now by tapping patiently
and wetting the wood occasionally
loosen the bark from the hard wood so that
it will at last slip off like a tube; this requires
care and gentle handling. Now
take the hard wooden core and cut into it,
from the middle to within half an inch of
one end, a deep curving cavity, and from
this to the other end cut off a shallow horizontal
slice. This core can now be slipped
into the tube of bark again and a neat semicircular
hole cut in the latter above the
cavity in the core, and you will find this
an excellent whistle. Scottish children put
a small pea into the cavity before replacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it into the tube of bark to make it "birl"
when blown&mdash;this is a great improvement.</p>

<p class="b1">This is another whistle made of a short
length of bamboo cane, which is hollow, cut
just below one of the "knots" or divisions
where the hollow tube is blocked by a solid
wall of the wood. If you cannot get this,
block one open end of your hollow tube of
wood with a cork, and for the other cut a
piece of cork or wood to fit, with a slice off
to leave an opening into the tube. Now cut
semicircular holes in your tube at intervals.
These will each produce a different note if
the others are stopped with the fingers, and
with care a regular sequence of the notes
of a scale can be planned. This sequence
will depend on the size of the tube&mdash;its
length, and the distance between the holes.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A BUZZER</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A large button or small round of leather or thin

</div></div>

<p class="p1">This can be simply made by threading a
large button on a string, so that when the
ends are knotted together it makes a loop
about twelve to fifteen inches long. Keeping
the button in the middle of the doubled
length of string insert the first and second
fingers of each hand into the looped ends,
and rapidly whirl the button round till the
string gets a considerable twist on it. Now
by alternately slacking and tightening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
string the button will whizz round with a
slight humming noise. If a piece of tin
with notched edges (as in Figure 51 of a
windmill) is used, it will hum very loud. A
piece of heavy lead foil, or a piece of firm
leather cut into a round and notched at the
edge can be used.</p>

<p class="p1">This can be made of two of the boxes
used for incandescent gas mantles; the box
for the larger inverted mantles is best. Remove
the lids from each end and cut off the
rims carefully, so that you have two neat
rings of cardboard. Slip one of these on
to one end of each box and over each rim
tightly tie a circle of greaseproof paper&mdash;such
as is used for covering jam pots or
parcelling butter. Better still, use a piece
of bladder from the butcher's. Fasten this
down very tight and firm, and through the
middle of each paper or bladder insert and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
knot the end of a fine piece of string which

cut along the line marked. Now bend the
cardboard over into a conical trumpet
shape, and overlap the sides where they
join, about an inch. Lay over this join a
broad strip of cloth or paper pasted or
glued firmly; you can put pins through the
cardboard till this is set into place and
dried. Now at the pointed end of the cone
cut a mouthpiece wide enough to speak
easily into; this will need a hole about
three inches wide. When you speak into
this megaphone your voice will carry a
long distance&mdash;a quarter of a mile on a
quiet evening&mdash;and it will give great fun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to watch the effect on people who are walking
at some distance in the country. For
convenience in holding you can paste on to
the outside a loop or handle of tape, but do
not push this through the cardboard as it is
important that there should be nothing
projecting inside the trumpet of the megaphone.</p>

forms the curved back, and curve it into
place and tie it round here and there with a
little wool to keep it firm while the seat is
being made. This will be better described
by the diagram than by words. Each rush

<p class="p1">This shows how to make beads of various
shapes out of paper; it can be of any color.
To make the long pointed beads marked A,
take a ruler and rule on your paper lines as
in B, and if the paper is thin they should be
strips about twelve inches long, and the
wider end of the wedge can be one inch or
one and a half inches. The strip must
taper to a point at the other end. Now take
the wide end of your strip and roll it very
tightly and evenly round a steel knitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
needle with the colored side out, and fix
down the point neatly with mucilage as in
the darkened portion in the diagram.
Smaller beads of various shapes can be
made, but all on the same method. Leave
the beads on the knitting needle till the
mucilage is quite dry, and give them a coat
of clear varnish. Such beads look well also
with blobs of paint or gilt on them.</p>

measured and cut very accurately before
beginning to put them together; use a very
sharp penknife to do the cutting. The pins
used should be fairly strong ones. In the
diagrams a broad piece of tape or ribbon
has been stretched tightly round the spars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
back and front, and its end stitched together
underneath, but this is not necessary.
Two or more spars can be set across

<h2 class="p4">BOW AND ARROW</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A branch of pliable smooth wood, strong twine, a
penknife, two goose quills.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 86 and 87.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Take a smooth even branch of willow,
cane, or other pliable wood about three
quarters of an inch thick and about two
feet or two and a half feet long, and round
the smaller end cut a shallow groove about
one and a half inches wide, and about half
an inch from the end. About one inch from
the thicker end cut a notch sloping inwards
towards the middle of the stick just deep
enough to hold firm a piece of strong
string. Next bind round about four inches
at the middle of the stick with string, laying
the end of the string along the stick, so
that the binding will cover it all but three
inches. Bind the four inches very closely,
and tie the end of the binding to the spare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
end of the string and knot it and cut away
the ends. Now bind over in the same way,
round the groove at the end of the stick,
and knot the free end of the string to the
spare end under the binding, and stretch
the free end of the string very taut, so that
the stick bends a little. Make a loop in the
end of the string which can be easily
slipped in and out of the notch at the other
end of the bow. When not in use keep the
looped end loose from the notch.</p>

<p>The arrows must be of very straight
light sticks or thin bamboo, and must be
scraped or sandpapered perfectly smooth.
At the point cut a long slit, and into it slip
a long and very slender nail, and bind it
round across the notch with strong linen
thread. You can file off the head of the
nail. At the other end make a similar but
longer notch, and into it slip a portion of
a quill feather with one side of the webbing
practically cut away. Arrange both pieces
of the quills so that they project the same
distance at each side from the wooden
shaft. Bind round the arrow with linen
thread both above and below the quills, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
at the extreme end deepen the mouth of the
notch so that it makes a groove into which
you can fit the string of the bow.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A DART</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A six-inch stick of soft wood, a long nail, pincers,

<p class="p1">This dart is made of a piece of soft wood
about six inches long, and into
the sharpened end a slim long
nail is driven; the head may
be nipped or filed off so that
the point will stick into the
ground or into a target.
Across the other end cut or
saw two notches at right
angles, for about one inch
down, and fit into these a
square of paper folded neatly
into "diagonals and diameters"&mdash;this
makes the "feathering" of the
dart. Smooth the dart with sandpaper.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A CROSSBOW</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A bow-stick of pliable wood, strong string, a smooth
lath of thin wood, a fret saw, an awl, a penknife, a
long nail.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-114.jpg" width="400" height="324"

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 89 and 90.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This bow is made somewhat more elaborately
than in Figure 86, and shoots off
pebbles or bullets. The bow itself must be
tapered evenly towards either end, and in
the middle it must be bevelled flat for about
two and a half inches at one side, and a
slight groove run right round the stick at
either end of the bevelled portion. Next
take a thin lath or flat thin piece of wood, a
quarter of an inch thick and rather less
than the length of the bow. Taper it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
two and a half inches wide at one end to
one and a half at the other, and lay the
broad end across the flattened portion of
the bow with about one inch projecting.
Mark on the crosspiece the width of the
bow-stick and cut into each side of the
crosspiece a deep sharp nick, leaving
about one inch between each opposite set
of nicks. Now draw your bow to the full
extent of its curve without running the
risk of breaking it, and mark on the crosspiece
where the bowstring crosses it when
the bow is drawn, and here cut a narrow
slot right through the crosspiece. Into
this insert a trigger as in Figure 90. The
trigger must be of wood and should curve
at one or both ends, and should be pinned
through into its slot with a long thin nail,
in such a position that the curved end will
broad end across the flattened portion of
full, and will lie well into the slot when the
string is released. Now bind the crosspiece
on to the side of the bow by strings
fitting tightly into the four nicks and running
round the grooves round the bow-stick.
This will leave the crosspiece free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of any bindings which might interfere with
the bullet or "quarrel" as it leaves the bow.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A CATAPULT</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A forked branch, strong round elastic, a scrap of

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Take a firm forked branch about three
quarters of an inch thick, or a little less,
and trim the two forks evenly, and run a
groove about three quarters of an inch
wide round each, near the end. Into these
bind very tightly two pieces of very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
round elastic about five inches long. Next
take a firm piece of leather about one inch
wide and two inches long, trim it away at
the corners, and make a hole at each end
into which insert the free ends of the elastic,
turning them back on themselves and
binding firmly. It may be well to mention
that there are very strict police regulations
about shooting with bows and catapults,
and those who use them must only do so
away from houses or traffic.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A TARGET</h2>


<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A bandbox, thin paper, string, scissors, ink, and

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">A very simple target may be made by
using a round bandbox and stretching over
its open mouth a piece of newspaper, which
may be kept in place by slipping over it
the rim taken off the
lid. Mark roughly
on this the "Bull's
Eye" in ink, and hang
up the box by means
of loops of string
through the side. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
newspaper can be renewed as often as is
necessary. A square box will do just as
well.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="p4">A RAFT</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A quantity of reeds or thin straight twigs, a piece
of cork, strong string.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-118.jpg" width="400" height="131"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is made of dry reeds or any other
light straight sticks&mdash;bamboo is good. It
may be made of any size and may even be
made large enough to carry one or more
persons, if the size and strength of the
branches and lashings is duly proportioned,
but for a toy reeds will do nicely. Lay
down first the crossbar beneath the raft
and then space out the raft itself to fit it,
leaving a little space between each reed.
Take a strong thin string and fasten it with
a tight loop over the end of the first reed,
turn it down and round the lower cross-spar,
and then up and around the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
one, and lay in the next reed, and so on.
When the first row of lashings is done lay
on the second pair of crossbars, and if
there is any difficulty about lashing the
string a large darning-needle may help you,
but if the lashing is done in the right direction
this is not needful. If a mast is wanted,
a reel, or a cork with a hole in it, may
be lashed down to the raft as in the diagram,
and the mast can be set firmly into
this.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="p4">A CANOE</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Some cheap cloth or shelving, some "basketry
cane," soft string or fine tape, scissors, penknife, a
large strong needle.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-119.jpg" width="400" height="107"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">The best material for this is thin shelving
cloth and it must be made at least
twelve inches long. Double your shelving
cloth, and outline on it the pattern of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
side of the canoe, which should be cut in
brown paper; this must be quite straight
at the upper sides, not curving as it appears
in the drawing. Lay the paper pattern
with the line of the bottom of the canoe
at the fold of the oilcloth. Now take
two long pieces of cane, such as is used for
basket-work, and with a large needle, and
very thick thread, lash each length of cane
along the outsides of the boat from end to
end, keeping the shiny side of the cloth outwards.
A short thick tapestry needle is
best, and the lashing must be steady and
even, but if it is difficult to stitch through
the cloth an awl or pricker can be used to
make the holes before beginning to stitch.
Now take another piece of cane and bend
about one inch at one end and lash this
bent portion to the side of the boat about
one-third of the way along the "gunwale"
where it is already lashed, and lash it over
firmly to this on the inside of the boat.
Bend the cane now across to the opposite
side of the canoe and meantime tie tightly
together the ends of the cane that is lashed
from end to end of the boat, and set in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
crosspiece so that it keeps the two sides
of the boat apart at the right angle. Fix
in the second crosspiece likewise, and then
lash the open ends of the boat firmly together.
The canoe should be rather wide
and shallow, or it will be inclined to lie on
its side unless ballast is added by weighting
it at the bottom. If weight is needed
the best thing for this sort of boat is one
or two of the heavy lead buttons to be had
at a tailor's for weighting garments; they
can be lashed on with strong thread
through the holes. Quite large canoes can
be made in this way, and if a tight "decking"
of thin waterproof material be
stretched across at both ends from the
crosspiece it makes a vessel almost identical
with the Eskimo "kayak" which used
to be used round the coasts not so very
long ago.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A SHIP</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>A block of soft wood ten or twelve inches long,
about three inches wide and two inches deep, nine
post cards, three skewers or old wooden knitting-pins,
a cork, a piece of heavy wire, dressmakers' eyelets,
some small staples, fine string, a gimlet, a sharp
penknife, small tacks, scissors, mucilage.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-123.jpg" width="400" height="238"

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This is the simplest sort of a ship to
model in wood; all wooden boats require
carefulness in their modelling and balance.
This can be made from six to twelve inches
long, and in soft wood. Let your block of
wood be about four times its width, roughly
speaking. Rule a line up to center of
your block to mark the keel and cut away
from this with a very sharp knife to the
curving outlines of the deck which must be
drawn on the top side of the block. It
would be impossible, in the space allowed
for diagrams, to give details for modelling
the body of the boat, but any boy can shape
it if he is careful and observes, from pictures
or actual boats or models, how to do
it. When the body of the vessel is shaped
and smoothed down with a file and sandpaper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
take a piece of heavy thick wire, and
bend it at either end and sharpen the ends
into points with a file and hammer it into
the keel; or, if preferred, a deep groove
may be cut with a gouge and a strip of lead
inserted. The rudder suggested here can
be made either of wood, or of a double
piece of tin with a piece of thick wire hammered
in at the fold and left with one end
projecting, so that it fits through a hole
in the stem and forms a tiller. The rudder
must have a hole pierced at the lower corner,
and into this fix a small staple which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
must work loosely in its hole, and after the
rudder is fixed in position this staple must
be hammered into the stern of the boat.
Figure 95 A shows the stern end with rudder
fixed into place. Next cut a bowsprit
of wood and with two staples fix it firmly
on to the deck. Take three pieces of cork
or three half reels, and glue or nail them to
the deck&mdash;this will make a good hold for
the masts. Then along each side of the
boat at intervals fasten on a strong dressmaker's
"eye" (for a hook) with its two
small loops bent so that they overlap; the
nail can be set through this. These eyelets
are meant to hold the "stays" which keep
the masts steady. Now take nine postcards,
and about half an inch from the edge in the
middle of each long side cut neatly a hole
big enough to slip your masts through, with
a strong needle, a piece of strong thin
string or stout linen thread, knotting it
with a large knot at the end. Lay the post
cards flat so that they just touch and set
the mast through the holes&mdash;a long wooden
knitting-pin makes a capital mast&mdash;and the
knob can be left on to finish it at the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
About one inch or more above the top sails
make a slight groove round the mast, and
round this bind tightly the threads laced
through the cards, tightened so that each
card bends a little; carry down these
threads or stays now to the eyelets and
fasten them firmly. Take another stay to
the bowsprit and lash it down and carry it
on to meet the front of the keel, and fasten
it in with a tiny tack or a pin. Gum on
small paper flags to the masts. This makes
quite a good little sailing ship and it is not
difficult to make.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a little propeller which with certain
alterations can be fixed to any boat.</p>

<p>Take a piece of tin, as in Figure A, and
pierce it with two holes and file them quite
smooth, and slightly bend
either end left and right
from the holes. Now take
a piece of thin wood cut as
in the diagram, with a long
wide slot, so that it forms a
sort of fork, and with
screws or tacks hammer
this on to the stern of your
vessel at the two holes, so
that it projects with the
whole fork clear of the vessel. Now thread
strong elastic through the holes in the tin
blades of the propeller with the ends knotted
firmly, making a double loop, each end
looping over the respective forks. Twist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
this tightly round on the same principle as
in the making of the wishbone clapper, and
when the twist is released it will propel
your boat a considerable distance either
backwards or forwards according to the
direction the thread is twisted.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A DOLL</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>An old knitted stocking or pair of cotton gloves,
two shoe-buttons, strong thread, some brown or black
mending yarn, tissue paper, wadding, scissors, darning-needle.</b></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 97.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This doll is made of old stockings or old
knitted or woven gloves. If only black
stockings can be got it can be a nigger doll,
or it can have its face alone made of light-colored
glove. The stuffing must be of
tissue paper roughly shaped to the right
size and wrapped round with some yarn to
keep it shapely, or this may be again wrapped
round with a layer of cotton wadding.
Shape the arms and legs separately, and
fasten over the knitted covering very neatly
with big, but firm, stitches. Stitch a
line right through at the wrists and flatten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
out the hands, and make lines of stitching
to mark the fingers and the line of the toes:
make a sort of "dart" where the leg bends
at the ankle.</p>

<p>For the head&mdash;put an extra wad of soft
padding under the face portion so that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
very soft and bulgy, and stitch firmly into
this two shoe-buttons for eyes. Take a
large darning-needle and take your stitches
right through the head to the back; use
very strong doubled linen thread. The
knitted covering used for the head may be
all gathered into the back and simply flattened
roughly into place with big stitches,
as you will cover it with "hair" later on.
Now take your needle through again and
make the two tiny stitches for the nostrils,
and pull these stitches back very tight also.
Two more stitches form the mouth with a
wee one below to make a hollow below the
lips. Now firmly stitch the head into
place, and with brown or black knitting or
mending yarn carefully make large stitches
radiating from the crown of the head to the
forehead: do not pull these tight, and use
double wool if you like. Make long loose
loops of wool all round the back of the head
and above them stitch as before into the
crown. This makes a really very good doll
if it is carefully made, and not too hurriedly
done.</p>

<p class="p1">This is a very jolly little fellow, and he is
made of old kid gloves. His head and body
are stuffed with tissue paper. The head is
just wrapped with a square piece cut from
the wrist of the glove neatly gathered in at
each side and tightly tied. The loose ends
must then have each one corner trimmed
off in a sloping line towards the neck; this
forms his flappy pointed ears. Now get
two tiny rounds of gummed stamp-paper
and ink on each an eyeball, only partially
covering the paper, and gum these on for
the eyes, and with pen or paintbrush put
in his mouth and nose. You can give him
a very woeful expression if you make his
mouth turn down. Cover his body with the
back of the gloves, so that the three
"points" or rows of stitching make a trimming
for his jacket. The legs and arms
are made of slips of the kid stitched carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
over the flat wire used by milliners.
The ends of the strips are left free and cut
to a pointed flap to form feet and hands.
Stitch limbs and head very firmly into
place and bend at elbows and knees. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Brownie can be made to sit down and take
many different positions; he is a very lifelike
little doll. You can also make him a
wee nightcap out of a knitted glove and
put a feather in it, and dress him with a
little cloak.</p>

<h2 class="p4">KITES</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Thin straight sticks of canes, strong paper or thin
cotton material, strong thin string, strong paste, large-eyed
needle.</b></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Figs. 99 to 101.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">These are several of the commoner and
easier kites to make. They are usually
made of paper pasted over the frame, but
it is in all cases better if children will take
the trouble to make their kites of thin cotton
material and tack or baste it into place
with large neat stitches; this really takes
very little more time than pasting. The
frames in every case should be of the lightest
and straightest sticks possible to find.
You can sometimes get very good ones
which are used in strengthening cardboard
boxes, or if you do not mind spending a few
cents the narrow slips of wood used in
making picture-frames are the very thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and any picture-framer can supply them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most usual kite is that
shown in Figure 99. The two cross-sticks
are first firmly lashed in position and the
ends notched and tightly fixed in place with
tight "stays" of string. Now cut your paper
or cloth at least two inches wider all
round than the outline of your framework,
cutting away the angles at the corners, so
that you have a neat flap to turn over all
round. Never use gum or mucilage for a
kite, good strong paste is best, if it is to be
made of paper. Now at the three points
where your "balances" are to be attached
to the kite, paste on a little square patch of
cloth so that the string or "balance" as it is
called does not tear the fabric or paper, and
fasten the ends of your two strings through
the two upper patches and knot it firmly
round your wooden framework. The loose
ends of your balances must now be run
through the third patch and fastened to the
vertical spar of the frame. The string of
the kite is fastened round these balances by
a slipknot. Next add the tail, which needs
careful adjustment to the weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
kite; it can be weighted with rolls of paper
at intervals, or little bundles of fresh grass.
Scottish boys often weight it at the end
with a "divot" which is a little piece of
actual turf, both grass and root, all together.</p>

<p>Figures 100 and 104 are another form of
kite most commonly used in Scotland. This
needs only one straight spar of wood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the curved "bow" at the top can be made
of light cane, such as is used for basket-making;
or what is very good, if enough
can be got, is a length of flat steel such as
is used in lady's corsets. Fasten the "bow"
to the spar by lashing it into a notch or
groove at the top and bend it evenly and
fasten it firmly by stays of string as in
Figure 104, both across and to the end of
the spar. Now lay on to your paper or
cotton material and cut it out as before in
Figure 100, with a good turnover to paste
or stitch down, and add the patches where
the balances are attached. These kites look
very gay if a tassel of colored paper or wool
is added at each end of the bow.</p>

<p>Figure 101 is a very good kite to make if
a really large one is wanted. The two long
cross-spars of wood must be notched to fit
each other about one-third of their length
from the top of the kite, and stays of string
must be so arranged that they spread about
twice as wide at the bottom as they do at
the top. This kite must have four patches
to insert its balances through and the slipknot
of the kite-string is fixed around both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Another "balance" should be fixed from the
lower corners of the kite from which the
tail is hung. This is a very steady kite.</p>

<p>Figure 102&mdash;a box kite.</p>

<p class="b1">This is a comparatively modern form of
kite and looks very complicated. It is really
less so than it looks. Take two long narrow
strips of thin cotton material about
eight inches wide and four and a half feet
long (this is for a kite about thirty inches
long). Have four straight thin spars of
wood about thirty inches long, and after
joining the two ends of your strips of cloth
together make at intervals a narrow "casing"
into which insert the ends of your
spars. You can either place the casings
at equal distances on your material, or you
can arrange it so that the open ends of
your kite form oblongs. Now have four
flat spars of thin wood measured to make
diagonals at each "box" end of your kite,
and bore a tiny hole in the middle of each
to insert a pin when the kite is stretched.
At the ends of these diagonals cut a rectangular
notch to hold the spars apart, tie
the kite-string considerably nearer one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of the kite than the other, or you can attach
a balance and fix on the kite-string by
a slipknot. This kite needs no tail, and
can be folded and rolled away by slipping
out the diagonal spars.</p>

<p class="p1 b1">This can be made of very strong brown
paper pasted so as to form a wide tube, like
a large paper bag with the bottom cut out.
Only two spars are needed. Inside the paper
tubes arrange near each edge a circle
of cane, as is used in basket-work or for
stretching out the crown of a cap. Set this
into place and lace through the paper a
strong string and lash the cane through to
the spar. This should hold quite steady if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
it is well done, but it can, of course, have a
third straight spar if necessary. Attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the string as in the other box kite.</p>

<p class="p1">Figures 105, 106, 107&mdash;a plane kite.</p>

<p>This is a most beautiful and graceful kite
and combines the box kite and the older
varieties. The box portion is made with
casings run into the cotton material at
equal intervals so as to form a three-sided
box. Fix in your three spars, all equal in
size, and along each side fix a plane, or
wing, of thin cotton material; it can be of
another color and looks very gay if this is
done. Make a little bag or pocket at the
outer corner of each wing, and into this
insert the ends of the fourth spar, so that
the latter may be slipped out and the kite
folded up. The string should be attached
near the "nose" of the kite. It needs no
tail.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A MONKEY ON A STICK</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Some thin three-ply wood, two long knitting-pins,
two small reels, a piece of hat wire, some small
staples, pliers, an awl, a fret saw, water color paints
and brushes, mending wool.</b></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 108.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">Draw your monkey carefully on the
three-ply wood, the body and limbs all separate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and a thin stump on to which the tail
must be fastened. With the awl pierce tiny
holes through arms, body, and legs, where
they are attached, and insert a piece of
wire, and with the pliers turn a small close
knot in it on each side to prevent it coming
out. Small wire paper clips will do instead
if they can be got. Now saw off the rims
of your two reels&mdash;they must be the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
size&mdash;and into one of your reels fasten two
staples over the pin and into the reel, so
that they hold the pin very tightly, catching
the pin just at one end. With another
staple through each hand fasten the arms
of your monkey to this reel, and slip the
other reel round the same knitting-pin and
extend your monkey to its fullest length,
and now fix the other knitting-pin to the
second reel so that its point projects a little
way through the first reel. Keeping
the monkey stretched to its fullest length
fasten his feet with staples to the second
reel, and be sure that the limbs work quite
loosely in these staples. Now with mending
yarn make a tassel and fasten it to the
end of your hat wire, and wrap the wire all
the way up with it almost to the end. Then
proceed to lash the wire to the stump of
the tail and bend the tail in a nice curve;
this will vibrate when your monkey is
worked up and down.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A DANCING LADY</h2>

<p class="pn p2 b1"><span class="smcap">Materials Required</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="b1"><b>Strong heavy white cardboard or thin wood, sharp
knife or fret saw, crinkled paper, water color paints,
a tiny portion of a quill, a tiny roll of tin or lead
foil, small fine pins or wire, a small piece of narrow
ribbon, a little writing paper, mucilage, string, scissors,
pliers.</b></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pn center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109.</span></p>
</div></div>

<p class="p1">This dainty little figure can be made to
dance along a double string and can be very
pretty. Cut out the body and legs and
arms all separately; they may be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
on white paper, or cut out and pasted on to
the cardboard. If you find it difficult to
make a pretty face, a suitable one may be
cut from some picture post card and pasted
on. The arms and legs must be fastened
on to the body with a little wire which
should be run through a tiny bead and
twisted so that it does not come out. Roll
the lead foil into a little long weight and
stitch one down to the lower portion of
the body both at the back and front. The
crinkled paper skirt must be gathered on
a draw-thread with a needle and tied evenly
and tightly round the waist and fastened
neatly with a little ribbon sash. Through
the stomach of the little figure insert a
tiny length of the quill of a feather and
glue it into place; let it project towards the
back more than the front. Through this
quill run your string doubled so that there
is a long loop both back and front and be
sure that the string works easily through
the quill. A portion of a tiny reel will do
instead of a quill if it is glued on to the
back. The object of the quill or reel is to
form a tube, so that the figure will slip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
along this when the string is slackened,
but that it will hold firm whenever the
string is tightened. The weights must be
heavy enough to make the figure balance
and run downwards as the string is sloped.
A pair of butterfly wings can be cut out of
writing paper and painted and fastened to
the back. A little garland of everlasting
flowers or moss or beads can be fastened to
the hands if you wish to do so.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A MODEL AEROPLANE</h2>

<p class="p1">This model was made by a boy of eleven
and is most beautifully proportioned and
put together. The body and wings and
floats and little boats are all made of the
white wood, well smoothed with sandpaper;
the steering-gear is of cardboard. The
propeller is made of mahogany and the
tiny wind-screens of semicircles of mica.
All is put together with "laundry" pins.
The ailerons on the upper planes are held
by strips of narrow tape.</p>

<h2 class="p4">A FARMYARD</h2>

<p class="p2 b1">Such toys as this can only be suggested
very briefly, but children with any common
sense and imagination can make most elaborate
and delightful collections.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p class="b1">The box used for the byre or stable is
only one of many more elaborate buildings
that can be made. The dwelling house of
larger boxes, the barns, the haystacks, the
pigsty, the chicken coop, troughs, and such
things can all be made of larger or smaller
boxes. Buildings can be thatched with
straw, rushes, hay; or corrugated paper
may be put on the roof. The palings here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
are made of matches set into posts of
wooden pegs, much like those used by
gardeners to label plants. Trees and flowering
plants can be made by getting small
bushy bare twigs and wrapping their
branches with moss, or fastening on everlasting
flowers of gay dyed colors. Old
sponges may be dyed green and cut up and
fixed in the branches. A reel sawed in two
makes a good plant pot for these.</p>

<p>The sheep illustrated here is made of a
cork, with legs of matches. Its head is a
tiny bean fixed to the cork with a pin, both
neck and body are wrapped in cotton wool,
and it is neatly fastened on with white
mending yarn. The lamb is made of a
large bean and a small one, with legs of
pins; the beans must be soaked before setting
in the pins. Noah's ark animals can
be used to increase the live stock of the
farm. Fields can be made of green crinkled
paper, and a piece of glass or a tiny mirror
can be used to make a pond. Carts, barrows,
and farm implements can be made of
all sorts of things, and clever children can
really make wonderful farms. Windmills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and other simple machines can be introduced
also.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="p4">A DOLL'S HOUSE</h2>

<p class="p2 b1">These can be made of bandboxes or
orange-boxes and can be either very simple
or as elaborate as you please. If cardboard
boxes are used, Figure 113 shows how it
can most easily be arranged to give the
pitch of the roof. One story may be piled
on another so that the house can be enlarged
at will. Doors and windows are
easily cut in the cardboard boxes. The
windows can also be glazed if you get a
few rolls of cinematograph film and fit and
paste it on, but children must be warned
that this is very inflammable and it is dangerous
to bring it near the fire or gas. The
inside of the rooms may be papered, and on
the walls little pictures may be pasted. The
illustrated catalogues from furniture shops
can often be cut up, and the diagrams of
doors, etc., cut out and pasted on the doors
of your house. Figure 112 shows a sitting-room
and a little shop or kitchen. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
latter the counter and dresser are made of
matchboxes. The shelves are of strips of
cardboard with uprights of cane, wire, or
knitting-needles. The fireplace in the sitting-room
can be made of a lid of a cardboard
box stitched to the wall, and in it
another box (a matchbox, for instance)
can be set to make the grate. A good table
can be made as in Figure 114, which is
made by using a lid of a small box, and to
the inside of its corners glueing the legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and then the larger top of thick cardboard
can be fixed on with mucilage. The little
shields for the corks of bottles, made of
pleated lead foil, make very pretty pots
and kitchen vessels in such little houses.
Rugs can be woven of wool and string, and
cushions, etc., to furnish the place. But
there is no end to the things a child can
make for a doll's house if imagination is encouraged
to work the hands.</p>

<p class="p1">Other "Community Toys" can be made&mdash;railway
stations, signals, and signal-boxes
are very popular; a market place with its
little tented stalls is charming. The houses
we see in pictures of foreign lands give
great interest, and many are so easy to
make that it is quite possible to illustrate
the history of home building by means of a
series of toy houses. The darker side of
life has even invaded our nurseries, and
they too have shown the games of the
trench and the guns: and it will be good to
plan in our playwork now for the rebuilding
of the world in the ways of peace, for it
is these children of ours who must lead the
world back or forward, for better or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
worse. All the world is in their hands,
though the hands may not yet be strong
for more than the making of toys. We older
children do but play other games with
more serious intent, yet all the same the
difference between the game and the business
is but a difference of degree.</p>
